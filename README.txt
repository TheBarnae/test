
THIS NOTE IS FOR INFORMING YOU THAT SUBMITTING THE OUTPUT VIA ZIP WILL BREAK THE WEBSITE.

I COULDNT UNDERSTAND A SINGLE THING ABOUT SUBMITTING IT ON GITHUB EVEN YOUTUBE COULDNT TEACH ME.

SO INSTEAD, I INSERTED PHOTOS AND VIDEO INSIDE THE ZIP FILE UNDER THE "MEDIA FOLDER" IF EVER THE WEBSITE BROKE.

THAT IS MY OUTPUT.





							THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING, 
									HAVE A GREAT DAY! :)
